(Each project in the 42 Common Core contains an encoded hint. For each
circle, only one project provides the correct hint needed for the
next circle. This challenge is individual, with a final prize for
one student. Staff members may participate but are not eligible for a
prize. Are you among the very first to solve a circle? Send the hints
with explanations to ol@42.fr to be added to the leaderboard. The
hint for this first project, which may contain anagrammed words, is:
Wolf of agentive particles that disprove greeny to your homes dna
that prowse your stool)

Anagram and possible translation
Wolf of agentive particles that disprove greeny to your homes dna that prowse your stool
(Flow of negative particles that provides energy to your homes and that powers your tools)
